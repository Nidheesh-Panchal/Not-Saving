# Not-Saving
Save notification of WhatsApp and Instagram in .txt file to look at it even if its been removed by the other person

Further improvements possible:
1. Mute notification for such apps for which you want to see notifications but don't want any sound.
2. Get notification sound for some priority apps which can be selected and notification sound can be played even in silent mode.
3. Can log all notification. (But useless for every app)
